# Crypto.me Thirdweb

Crypto.me Thirdweb is a central profile page for web3 identities. It allows users to view and manage their Ethereum Name Service (ENS) profiles, displaying the last error or the last successful sync time.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): A React framework for building web applications.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io): An open-source database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js. It is used for database access and management.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org): A self-contained, high-reliability, embedded, full-featured, public-domain, SQL database engine. It is used as the default database for local testing.

## Getting Started

To set up a local version of the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pierce403/crypto.me-thirdweb.git
cd crypto.me-thirdweb
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up the database:

The project uses SQLite for local testing. The database file `data.db` is automatically created in the project root directory. No additional setup is required.

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Database Setup and Maintenance

The project uses SQLite as the default database for local testing. The database file `data.db` is automatically created in the project root directory. To manage the database schema, Prisma is used. Here are some useful commands:

- To apply database migrations:
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev
  ```

- To generate Prisma client:
  ```bash
  npx prisma generate
  ```

- To open the Prisma Studio for database management:
  ```bash
  npx prisma studio
  ```
